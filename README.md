# personal-site
A work in progress personal site with portfolio and blog

I want to use mobile first design, and ensure that the site degrades gracefully.

After I have implemented basic functionality, I want to use this site as a holder
for writing and for my web design projects. I'd also like to use it to explore some more experimental design
